# Contamination in Published Microarray Studies Retrospectively Detected by Deep Learning
In the Microarray study, we retrospectively constructed 37,724 raw microarray images, and developed a deep learning algorithm to automatically detect defects in the original images. Here we provide the identified problematic arrays, affected genes and the imputed arrays as well as software tools to scan for such contamination as a resource to the research community to help future studies to scrutinize and critically analyze these data. 
Please contact (yananq@umich.edu or gyuanfan@umich.edu) if you have any questions or suggestions.

## Dataset
The data can be directly downloaded from [https://osf.io/g4qxu/?view_only=3aaf0f0469744e54befbc4f86143ab47] on Open Science Framework:
* recovered: contains 1703 recovered samples 
* Contam_genes: contains the list of contaminated genes for every positive sample
* label: human-labelled microarray images

## Codes for experiments 

### Recovering of microarray images from CEL files
Download the folder 'reconstruct_to_image' and run the following command:
```
python3 setup.py build
python3 test_full.py
```

### Create positive labels 
Download folder 'make_label' and run the following command:
```
perl Pick.pl
perl Split_processed.pl
python3 label.py
```

### Train 
Open split_5cv.ipynb and run the code inside. This step is to split the data set into 5 folds for the futural five-fold Cross Validation.
For training, directly run 
```
bash bash-cv1.sh
bash bash-cv2.sh
bash bash-cv3.sh
bash bash-cv4.sh
bash bash-cv5.sh
```

### Prediction
Users can run prediction code using our saved model. Download the 'predict' folder, then
```
python3 pred-cv1.py
python3 pred-cv2.py
python3 pred-cv3.py
python3 pred-cv4.py
python3 pred-cv5.py
```
Then open dice_index.ipynb to calculate the dice coefficient

### Expression data in contaminated regions showed less coordinance within probesets
Download folder 'compare_var', and open gene_expression.ipynb, run the code inside. Then
```
Rscript get_RMA.R
python3 Var_compare.py
```
Open and run Var_compare.ipynb, you can access the result.

### Literature mining
Download folder 'crawl' and run crawl.py using the following command 
```
python3 crawl.py
```

### Recover Contaminated Probes
Download folder 'recover' and run the code in recover.ipynb. Inside the ipynb file, there are some commands to ask you run R and python code:
```
Rscript recover.R
python3 recover_intensity.py 
python3 recover_save_to_map_txt.py
```
Contam_list.ipynb is to give the list of contaminated genes in samples tested as positive



## Vignettes -- if you want to test whether your sample has contamination
Have the microarray CEL file in hand.
Before doing the first step, make sure you have changed the directory in cel_to_img.py to the one of your cel file
First of all, you would need to recover your microarray cel file to an image:
```
python3 setup.py build 
python3 cel_to_img.py
```
The result is a image png file converted from microarray CEL file. 

Then run the following command:
```
python3 Example/pred_example.py
```
This command will have two resulting files:
* result.npy: the prediction result generated by our model
* contam_genes.txt: contains the genes whose probes locats at contaminated area
In order to recover the contaminated region, you should have the original CEL file in hand, and run the following command:
```
Rscript Example/recover_example.R
python3 Example/recover_example.py
```
Then recovered.txt will be the recovered probe intensities.

## If you want to use our recovered microarray data
Our recovered data is available to be downloaded from Open Science Framework. Note that our recovered data only has 1703 microarray samples with defects, so please check data availability before using.
* Microarray recovered probe expression: contains 1703 recovered samples. The recovered probe expressions of every sample were saved in a TXT file with the same name as CEL file. We save the recoverd value as: probe id: value. 
* contam_genes: contains the list of contaminated genes for every positive sample
For example, if your CEL is called XX.CEL, XX.CEL.txt in Microarray recovered probe expression contains recovered probe expression and XX.CEL.txt in contam_genes contains a list of genes with defects.
